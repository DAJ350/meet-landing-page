## My process

I started off creating the structure of the landing page with HTML. I utilised the BEM naming convention to allow for easy identification of elements and components and to set myself up for better scalability in the future.

I then proceeded to create the styling rules. I initially started off creating the responsive styles all at the same time but quickly found how tedieous this was and reverted back to tackling one design at a time.  

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM

### What I learned

I used this project to check how long on approximately it currently takes me to complete a project of this scale. In total, I spent approximately 13 hours to complete this project. I know I likely should at an extra time just to give myself the buffer to safety. So 15 - 16 hours. 


### Continued development

If I was to return to this project, I likely will add some more finer media queries for screen sizes between 1440px and 990px to adjust the width of the text in the benefits section. 

### Useful resources

- [Clamp Value Calculator](https://marcbacon.com/tools/clamp-calculator/) - This helped me quickly figure out the clamp value required to create the fluid typography with the fonts.
